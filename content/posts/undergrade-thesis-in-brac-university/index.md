A Comprehensive Guide For Starting Undergrade Thesis In Brac University.

# What is this post about ?
---
This aims to serve as a guide that will help students to approach research work without any confusion while also remedying the fear about 'Thesis'.

CSE400 is a department core course , which means everyone has to do it to graduate from CS/CSE.

The course is divided into 3 parts.
